# ClassStructures

A C++ console application project designed to demonstrate the use of classes, objects, constructors, member functions, and basic object-oriented programming concepts. Built using Visual Studio (or another C++ development environment) as part of a classroom assignment.

---

## Project Overview

This project covers the following core concepts:

- Defining classes with private data members and public member functions.  
- Creating constructors (default, parameterized) and destructors (if needed).  
- Using objects to represent real-world entities (for example: `Book`, `Student`, `Vehicle`).  
- Using accessors (getters) and mutators (setters) to safely manage object state.  
- Implementing member functions to perform operations on class data.  
- Demonstrating interaction between objects (e.g., objects passed to functions, arrays or vectors of objects).  
- Input validation and formatted output for clear console display.  
- Clear code structure with header (`.hpp`/`.h`) and implementation (`.cpp`) files, and meaningful comments.

## Features

- Prompt the user to create one or more objects of a given class type (for example: create several `Student` objects).  
- Populate object data via user input or default values.  
- Display object information in a structured format (for example: listing all students, showing attributes like name, grade, ID).  
- Allow the user to modify object data using member functions (e.g., update grade, change state).  
- Optional: use an array or `std::vector` of objects to handle multiple instances.  
- Validate user input (e.g., non-empty names, valid numeric values).  
- Format the output for readability using `iomanip`.

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++ (compatible with C++11 or later)  
- IDE: Visual Studio 2019/2022 (or any C++ compiler environment)  
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a system with a C++ compiler (Visual Studio preferred) and familiarity with basic C++ (variables, loops, functions) prior to using classes and objects.

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Javi1591/ClassStructures.git
cd ClassStructures
